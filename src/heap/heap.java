package heap;

// Add to the next empty spot (looking top to bottom, left to right)
// Bubble up to the right place
// Worst time complexity: O(logN)
// On average , the newly inserted element does not travel very far up the tree - O(1)
// Proof: http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Binary_heap

// Min Heap: Delete
// Swap the root with the last added element
// Bubble down - Compare with left and right child, swap with the smaller one
// Time Complexity - O(logN)

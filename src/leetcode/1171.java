Intuition
Assume the input is an array.
Do you know how to solve it?
Scan from the left, and calculate the prefix sum.
Whenever meet the seen prefix,
remove all elements of the subarray between them.


Solution 1
Because the head ListNode can be removed in the end,
I create a dummy ListNode and set it as a previous node of head.
prefix calculates the prefix sum from the first node to the current cur node.

Next step, we need an important hashmap m (no good name for it),
It takes a prefix sum as key, and the related node as the value.

Then we scan the linked list, accumulate the node's value as prefix sum.

If it's a prefix that we've never seen, we set m[prefix] = cur.
If we have seen this prefix, m[prefix] is the node we achieve this prefix sum.
We want to skip all nodes between m[prefix] and cur.next (exclusive).
So we simplely do m[prefix].next = cur.next.
We keep doing these and it's done.


Complexity
Time O(N), one pass
SpaceO(N), for hashmap


Java:

    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0), cur = dummy;
        dummy.next = head;
        int prefix = 0;
        Map<Integer, ListNode> m = new HashMap<>();
        while (cur != null) {
            prefix += cur.val;
            if (m.containsKey(prefix)) {
                cur =  m.get(prefix).next;
                int p = prefix + cur.val;
                while (p != prefix) {
                    m.remove(p);
                    cur = cur.next;
                    p += cur.val;
                }
                m.get(prefix).next = cur.next;
            } else {
                m.put(prefix, cur);
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
C++:

    ListNode* removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0), *cur = dummy;
        dummy->next = head;
        int prefix = 0;
        map<int, ListNode*> m;
        while (cur) {
            prefix += cur->val;
            if (m.count(prefix)) {
                cur =  m[prefix]->next;
                int p = prefix + cur->val;
                while (p != prefix) {
                    m.erase(p);
                    cur = cur->next;
                    p += cur->val;
                }
                m[prefix]->next = cur->next;
            } else {
                m[prefix] = cur;
            }
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
Python:

    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head):
        cur = dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prefix = 0
        seen = collections.OrderedDict()
        while cur:
            prefix += cur.val
            node = seen.get(prefix, cur)
            while prefix in seen:
                seen.popitem()
            seen[prefix] = node
            node.next = cur = cur.next
        return dummy.next

Improvement
I think that's the best part of my post.
It's a great discuss in the leetcode's discuss.

People are willing to read my article and help me improve it.
To be honest, I think I take good responsiblilty to maintain my solution.
(Though the case I don't have prime membership and canot even read my own post in locked problem)

Thanks to @alexjst inspired me the follwing solution.


Soluiton 2: Two Passes
The story is that,
I wrote the really concise solution,
it got accepted but actully it's wrong.
I fixed it by adding another while loop.
That is the Solution 1.

If we don't insist on one pass,
we can find the two passes is actually really neat.

That turned back to the intuition that I mentioned:
Assume the input is an array.
How will you solve the problem?

Iterate for the first time,
calculate the prefix sum,
and save the it to seen[prefix]

Iterate for the second time,
calculate the prefix sum,
and directly skip to last occurrence of this prefix

Java

    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {
        int prefix = 0;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        Map<Integer, ListNode> seen = new HashMap<>();
        seen.put(0, dummy);
        for (ListNode i = dummy; i != null; i = i.next) {
            prefix += i.val;
            seen.put(prefix, i);
        }
        prefix = 0;
        for (ListNode i = dummy; i != null; i = i.next) {
            prefix += i.val;
            i.next = seen.get(prefix).next;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
C++

    ListNode* removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        int prefix = 0;
        unordered_map<int, ListNode*> seen;
        for (ListNode* i = dummy; i; i = i->next) {
            seen[prefix += i->val] = i;
        }
        prefix = 0;
        for (ListNode* i = dummy; i; i = i->next) {
            i->next = seen[prefix += i->val]->next;
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
Python

    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head):
        prefix = 0
        seen = {}
        seen[0] = dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        while head:
            prefix += head.val
            seen[prefix] = head
            head = head.next
        head = dummy
        prefix = 0
        while head:
            prefix += head.val
            head.next = seen[prefix].next
            head = head.next
        return dummy.next

Update 2019-08-25
The OJ solution was wrong.
It didn't block the right submit,
but wrong submit can also get accepted.

Following the test case given by @kay_deep:
[1, 3, 2, -3, -2, 5, 100, -100, 1]
The expected result should be [1,5,1] or [1,3,2,1].

Some solution in the discuss part are still wrong.

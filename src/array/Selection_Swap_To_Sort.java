/*
Given an array and a sorting algorithm, the sorting algorithm will do a selection swap.
Find the number of swaps to sort the array.


For example the initical array is [5, 4, 1, 2], this is how the sorting algorithm works:


Swap index 0 with 1 to form the sorted array [4, 5, 1, 2].
Swap index 0 with 2 to form the sorted array [1, 5, 4, 2].
Swap index 1 with 2 to form the sorted array [1, 4, 5, 2].
Swap index 1 with 3 to form the sorted array [1, 2, 5, 4].
Swap index 2 with 3 to form the sorted array [1, 2, 4, 5].

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
all elements of arr are unique


Example:
arr = [8, 2, 3]
return 2
explanation:
Swap a[0] and a[1]. The resulting array is [2, 8, 3].
Swap a[1] and a[2]. The resulting array is [2, 3, 8].

Return the number of swaps which is 2.

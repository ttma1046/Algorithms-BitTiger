Given a string made up of integers 0-9, count the number of ways to split the string into primie numbers in the range of 2 to 1000 inclusive, 
using up all the charcters in the string.

Each prime number, pn, must not contain leading 0s, and 2 <= pn <= 1000.

Constrains:
The input string does not contain any leading 0s.

Examples:

example 1:
input: 31193
output: 6

Explanation

The string "31171" can be split into prime numbers in 6 ways:
[3, 11, 7, 3]
[3, 11, 73]
[31, 17, 3]
[31, 173]
[311, 7 , 3]
[311, 73]
